# 3BLD-Parity-Scrambler

https://tao-yu.github.io/3BLD-Parity-Scrambler/

This is a scrambler for 3x3 that has the following modes:

1. **Force Parity**: This ensures that every scramble will have 3x3 blindfolded solving parity
2. **Indicate Parity**: This will add an indicator next to each scramble indicating whether the scramble has 3x3 blindfolded solving parity or not.
3. **Force No Parity**: This ensures that every scramble will not have 3x3 blindfolded solving parity

Scrambles are random state.
